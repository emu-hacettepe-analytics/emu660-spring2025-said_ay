title: "Temporal and Regional Analysis of Earthquake Activity in Turkey (1995–2023)"
---

Welcome to our project page.

Here, you’ll find updates and insights from our ongoing exploration of earthquake patterns in Turkey.

# 1. Project Overview and Scope

Earthquakes remain one of the most pressing natural threats facing Turkey, a country intersected by several active fault lines—most notably the North Anatolian Fault Zone. Understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of seismic activity is crucial for disaster preparedness, urban planning, and seismic risk mitigation strategies.

This project focuses on analyzing the **temporal trends** and **regional distribution** of earthquakes that occurred in Turkey between **1995 and 2023**, using an openly accessible dataset published by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The dataset includes thousands of seismic events, each detailed with attributes such as time, location, magnitude, and depth, all confined within Turkey’s geographic boundaries (26°–45° E and 36°–42° N).

The primary research question driving this project is:

> **"How have earthquake frequency and magnitude changed in Turkey over time, and which regions show consistently higher seismic activity based on historical data?"**

To answer this question, the project sets the following objectives:

-   **Temporal Analysis**: Track annual or seasonal shifts in earthquake frequency and intensity.
-   **Spatial Mapping**: Visualize the geographic clustering of earthquakes to identify high-risk zones.
-   **Magnitude Patterns**: Investigate the distribution of magnitudes and how often stronger quakes occur.
-   **Risk Identification**: Identify areas of Turkey that exhibit consistently high seismic activity and may require closer monitoring or mitigation efforts.
-   **Visualization**: Produce clear and informative visualizations, including histograms, time series plots, and density maps, to support interpretations.

All analyses are performed in **R**, and the project is compiled and shared through a **Quarto-powered GitHub page**, making it fully transparent and reproducible. The final product is intended to be both informative and accessible to audiences interested in Turkey’s seismic landscape—whether in research, policy, or planning.

# 2. Data

Understanding the nature of seismic activity in Turkey requires a data-driven approach built on reliable, long-term records. This project builds on a dataset that spans almost three decades, offering a broad view of how seismic behavior has unfolded in different parts of Turkey. It allows not only for time-based comparisons, but also for mapping out regions with higher seismic exposure—making it an ideal foundation for exploratory and risk-focused analysis.

## 2.1 Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the [USGS Earthquake Catalog](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/), a widely used open-access platform that provides detailed global seismic activity records. For this project, we filtered the data to include only earthquakes that occurred within the borders of Turkey — specifically between 26°–45° Eastern longitudes and 36°–42° Northern latitudes — between the years 1995 and 2023. Additionally, only events with a magnitude of 2.0 or greater were included to focus on perceptible and potentially damaging seismic activity.

The dataset was downloaded in `.csv` format and contains information such as:

-   **Date and Time** of the earthquake\
-   **Magnitude**\
-   **Depth (in kilometers)**\
-   **Latitude and Longitude**\
-   **Place** (a descriptive region name)

After downloading, the data was imported into R for further exploration and preprocessing.

## 2.2 General Information About Data

The dataset consists of approximately **30,000 earthquake events** recorded in Turkey over a **28-year period**. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a unique seismic event, with detailed information such as the time it occurred, its geographical coordinates, how deep it originated, and how strong it was. Most earthquakes are naturally concentrated around Turkey’s well-known fault zones, such as the North Anatolian Fault in the north and the East Anatolian Fault in the southeast. This spatial clustering is something we aim to explore visually in the later sections of the project.

Here's a brief overview of the variables:

-   `time`: Timestamp of the earthquake (UTC), including date and hour\
-   `latitude` & `longitude`: Geographic location of the event\
-   `depth`: Depth below the surface in kilometers\
-   `mag`: Magnitude on the Richter scale\
-   `place`: Descriptive label provided by USGS, such as nearby city or region

Overall, The structure of the dataset is tidy and consistent, which makes it easier to analyze without extensive restructuring. Thanks to its clean structure, the dataset served as an effective and convenient entry point for our analysis.

## 2.3 Reason of Choice

There are several reasons why we chose this specific dataset:

-   First and foremost, earthquakes have always been a critical topic in Turkey, especially following the devastating seismic events in 1999 and more recently in 2023. Understanding patterns in historical data can offer valuable insights into risk mitigation.
-   Second, the dataset is both **rich** and **clean**, and doesn't require extensive preprocessing to begin analysis. It offers a long temporal range (1995–2023), which makes it ideal for trend detection.
-   Lastly, We wanted a dataset that is directly relevant to public safety and urban planning in Turkey. The output of this study could contribute to further academic or policy-oriented discussions about seismic preparedness.

## 2.4 Preprocessing

After importing the CSV file into R, several preprocessing steps were performed to prepare the dataset for analysis:

-   **Datetime Conversion**: The `time` column was converted into proper POSIXct format to enable time-based analysis.
-   **Filtering**: Earthquakes below magnitude 2.0 were excluded, since they are too weak to be of concern in a risk-focused study.
-   **Region Extraction**: The `place` column was parsed to extract province-level identifiers where possible.
-   **Derived Variables**: A `year` column was created from the datetime to allow annual comparisons.
-   **Missing Values**: The dataset contained minimal missing data, which were either filtered out or imputed where reasonable.

The cleaned dataset was saved in `.RData` format for reproducibility and faster processing in future sessions.

```{r}
eq_data <- read.csv("turkey_earthquake_data.csv")
eq_data$DateTime <- as.POSIXct(eq_data$time, format="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%OSZ", tz="UTC")
eq_data <- subset(eq_data, mag >= 3.0)
eq_data$year <- format(eq_data$DateTime, "%Y")
save(eq_data, file="eq_data.RData")
```
